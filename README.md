# 5G Device-to-Device (D2D) Communication Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing energy efficiency in 5G networks using Device-to-Device (D2D) communication techniques. The goal is to enhance both **energy efficiency** and **system throughput** by incorporating social-aware optimization methods that consider the social relationships between mobile users.

## Key Features
- **Energy Efficiency Optimization (EEO)**: Implemented adaptive genetic algorithms to maximize energy efficiency.
- **Interference Management**: Techniques to manage interference between D2D users and cellular users.
- **MATLAB Simulations**: Simulated the system to compare energy efficiency with other models.

## Files
- `functionEnergyEfficiency.m`: Function to calculate energy efficiency based on various parameters.
- `functionTransmissionDelay.m`: Function to simulate transmission delay in D2D communications.
- `main.m`: Main file to run the simulation and calculate system performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/5G_D2D_Optimization_Project.git
